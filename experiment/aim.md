In this experiment, we will see a fundamental problem related to graphs, Graph Traversal. It is nothing more than visiting every vertex of the given graph. Based on the order in which we visit the vertices, we define two different types of graph traversals. The order of vertices thus obtained can be useful in understanding several properties of the graph.

Two main techniques : Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS).
